These slides are actually bad. Good slides have as little text as
possible, and\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\bfseries
\item the text is large enough and it
\item has lots of free space around it.
\end{itemize}\bigskip

In addition,\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\sl
\item each slide contains at most 4 key elements, and
\item the audience is not expected to read and listen at the same time.
\end{itemize}
