My previous LaTeX Courses in Finnish and English. 

## Why LaTeX?

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a document preparation system originally published
in 1985 by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport). It is based on [Donald
Knuth's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) seminal work, the
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) system, dating back to
1978. Being greatly ahead of its time, LaTeX is nowadays used not only by mathematicians and
      computer scientists, but also as a back-bone for many automated document generation engines
(including the [R Vignette](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) long-term documentation
system).

There are several reasons why LaTeX is worth learning:

* Manuscripts are kept in plain text, and hence easily versioned (e.g. with Git) and collaboratively edited 
* Document generation can be automated 

Engines like pandoc can convert Markdown to PDF via LaTeX. Thus, you may not need to learn LaTeX in
full to be productive, but some background information is always useful.

These slides are some years old now, but I have got positive feedback about them and the LaTeX
system is generally very stable. For example, the newer English version compiles out-of-the box
with Fedora 27 and TeX Live 2017 (version 2017-05-24).
